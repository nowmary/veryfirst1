<p>I've got another <strong>confession</strong> to make
I'm your fool
Everyone's got their chains to break
Holdin' you
Were you born to resist or be abused?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_L4Rixya64" target="_blank" title="watch music video">the best of you?</a>
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Are you gone and on to someone new?
I needed somewhere to hang my head
Without your noose
You gave me something that I didn't have
But had no use
I was too weak to give in
Too strong to lose
My heart is under arrest again
But I break loose
My head is giving me life or death
But I can't choose
I swear I'll never give in
I refuse

Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Has someone taken your faith?
It's real, the pain you feel
You trust, you must
Confess
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
</p>


<p style="margin-top:80px;">I have got another confession my friend
I am no fool I am getting tired of starting again
Somewhere new Were you born to resist or be abused
I swear I will never give in I refuse</p>
