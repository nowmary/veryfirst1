Too alarmin' now to talk about
Take your pictures down and shake it out
Truth or consequence, say it aloud
Use that evidence, race it around
There goes Has someone taken your faith
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqWRaAF6_WY" target="_blank" title="watch music video">my hero</a>
Watch him as he goes
There goes my hero
He's ordinary
Don't the best of them bleed it out
While the rest of them peter out?
Truth or consequence, say it aloud
Use that evidence, race it around
There goes my hero
Watch him as he goes
There goes my hero
He's ordinary
Kudos, my hero, leavin' all the best
You know my hero, the one that's on
There goes my hero
Watch him as he goes
There goes my hero
He's ordinary


<p style="margin-top:80px;">I have got another confession my friend
I am no fool I am getting tired of starting again
Somewhere new Were you born to resist or be abused
I swear I will never give in I refuse</p>
