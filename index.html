<h2>I wellcome you</h2>

I have got another confession to make I am your fool
Everyone has got their <strong>chains to <u>break</strong></u> Holding you

<p><a href="https://foofighters.com/" target="_blank" title="go to official site">Has someone taken your faith</a>
It is real the pain you feel
The life, the love you would die to heal
The hope that starts the broken hearts
You trust you must Confess</p>


<p style="margin-top:80px;">I have got another confession my friend
I am no fool I am getting tired of starting again
Somewhere new Were you born to resist or be abused
I swear I will never give in I refuse</p>
