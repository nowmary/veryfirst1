<p>Keep you in the dark you know they all pretend
Keep you in the dark and so it all began

<strong>Send in your skeletons</strong>
Sing as their bones go marching in again
They need you buried deep
The secrets that you keep are at the ready
Are you ready
I'm finished making sense
Done pleading ignorance, that whole defense
Spinning infinity, boy
The wheel is spinning me
It's never ending
Never ending
Same old story

What if I say I'm not like the others
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays
You're <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBjQ9tuuTJQ" target="_blank" title="watch music video">the pretender</a>
What if I say I will never surrender
What if I say I'm not like the others
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays
You're the pretender
What if I say I will never surrender</p>
